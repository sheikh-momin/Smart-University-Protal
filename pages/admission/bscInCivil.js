            <h3>The Department of Civil Engineering offers a 4 years undergraduate Program of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. To become a graduate in this field one has to complete 160 credit hours. It is utmost necessity to enhance the quality of higher education in Bangladesh for national and global context. Eastern University (EU) is one of the private university trying to maintain quality education for creating the leader of the leaders since 2003. Department of Civil Engineering has projected itself as one of the vital departments of the science and engineering faculty. Almost all the physical infrastructure development of the country are the products of Civil Engineering. Construction, operation and maintenance of buildings, bridges, roads, railways, airports, embankment, river training, irrigation, canals, sea and river ports, power houses, transmission towers, dams and barrages etc. require the knowledge and technology of Civil Engineering. Experienced and learned teachers teach the courses based on Outcome Based Education (OBE) system. Eastern University is well equipped with necessary lab facilities for test, and research works. The academic programs of this University are continually being updated and improved to reflect the latest development in Engineering education. The EU firmly believes that education is not only the backbone of the nation but the quality education is the last resort of a nation to attain the quickest emancipation. Knowledge is not only the power, but also the super power in the changed context. The mission of Civil Engineering department is to become a department of quality and distinction enabling students to flourish academically, personally, and socially through obtaining soft skill by OBE system. The reason for offering Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering is to prepare students for a wide range of exciting industrial opportunities including construction, transportation, mining, roads and highway, aerospace, chemical, biomedical, nuclear power, robotics, and textiles. Civil Engineers can find employment in the field of construction and management, surveying, structural, geotechnical, water and transportation. <br /> <br />

              The program is designed to satisfy the growing demand of civil professionals throughout the country. It gives students the opportunity to obtain broad-base knowledge of Civil Engineering suitable for taking the challenge of building infrastructure that can minimize the natural and environmental hazards. It also gives freedom to tailor the program according to student’s individual needs by choosing the optional subjects available in higher semesters in the field of structural, geotechnical, environmental and transportation engineering. Moreover, there are sufficient numbers of Mathematics, Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Project Management and other basic science, commerce, Arts and Humanities courses. <br /> <br />

              Apart from academic activities, the students of the Department regularly take part in different co-curricular and extra-curricular activities such as programming conttest, debates, sprots competitions, games contests, welfare programs, etc.</h3>

            <h1 className="mb-3 text-teal-600 font-bold">Assessment Strategy</h1>
            <h3> A student with 12 years formal pre-University education (i.e. S.S.C. + H.S.C. or its equivalent) must complete sufficient courses for graduation that is he/she must earn at total of 160 credits that includes General Education (suggested by UGC), Basic Science and Mathematics, Core Engineering and Other Engineering courses. The following uniform grading system approved by the UGC for all Universities is applied in evaluating the examinations of students. The minimum passing grade for graduation is CGPA 2.50. The overall performance of a student will be expressed in terms of Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). A student can sit for any retake / improvement exam on payment of prescribed fees. Student’s performance evaluation in a course is shown in Figure. Students are continuously assessed through class attendance, participation, group discussion and Class tests. To maintain the quality education question papers should be prepared based on Bloom’s Taxonomy. Rubrics should be set out for every course so that every student ensure what criteria is maintained in the evaluation process of examination script.</h3>
